# Tower of Hanoi

This repository contains the recursive solution to the [Tower of Hanoi][1]
problem, written in multiple programming languages. The objective of the
mathematical game is to move the entire stack to the last tower, obeying
the following simple rules:

- Only one disk may be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and
  placing it on top of another stack or an empty tower.
- No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
